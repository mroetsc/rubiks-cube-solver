# rubiks-cube-solver
The origin of this repository is a school project. The goal was to teach an AI to solve a Rubik's Cube. The AI then transmits this solution to a physical robot, which implements the solution and solves the cube.   

Although the AI approach is certainly less effective than using a simple algorithm, their cooperation was to be pointed out. Because of this, AI was used.
